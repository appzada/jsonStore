    "emailMission1": "The Viper's plans are more advanced than we thought. He has developed a doomsday device that will release a secret cloud of gas over central London. We don't know what the gas will do. But we don't want to find out.\n\nThe device detonates in 60 minutes. Find it and defuse it before it’s too late. \n\nMission Notice: You must not enter any areas that are not open to the public or approach any live animals during this mission.",

    "revealcluesMission1": "The muddy footprints from the first clue revealed that the Viper had recently been in a park. The Viper gave away that he had been in Hyde Park by the way he mis-spelt 'hide and seek'. The Jester was telling a lie. You could tell this because he said the device was outside the Mission Map Area. The doomsday device was near both the horse track and the waterfall in Hyde Park, which meant the first location on the Army satellite map was the correct one. The code was 21-9-7-0.\n\n"
